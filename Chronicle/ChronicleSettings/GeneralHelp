Welcome to Chronicle! I'm here to help with the navigation and use of this program.

Side Menu
=========
You may have noticed a few buttons below the Chronicle brand on the left side of the window. We will briefly go over their functions.

Plus Sign - Creates a new, blank entry
Pencil - Edits the entry currently being viewed
Circle Arrow - Refreshes both the current entry and the entry list on the side panel of the program
H - Loads the help panel that you are on now
